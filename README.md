# Coral-Image-Study
Small tools for Coral image

## Introduction
This Python file is specifically designed to study RGB variations and the G/B ratio in coral UV images. During use, after running the program, you can select a coral image from your computer, then choose two points in the image as the start and end points. The file will generate a line chart showing the RGB values and their variations along the straight line between the two points, as well as the corresponding changes in the G/B ratio. Finally, you can choose to save the corresponding raw RGB data as a CSV file in a selected folder.

## Notice
The file is user-friendly, but you need to install the required Python packages before using it.
